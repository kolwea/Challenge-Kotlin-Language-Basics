# Challenge-Kotlin-Language-Basics
Description: Write a Kotlin application with a main function that utilizes constants, variables, data types, operators, expressions, statements, blocks, and control flow.

Purpose: This application provides experience in working with basic language features of Kotlin. It is important when working with a new language to understand how it handles its constants, variables, data types, operators, expressions, statements, blocks, and control flow. A good thing to always do with a new language is to build test applications where you experiment with these language features to make sure you understand how they work.
